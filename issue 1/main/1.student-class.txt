student-class.py
Issue 1: Intro to OOP
Courses for teachers at A-level generally explain how to create a class and how to create an instance
at the Python interpreter.
The user enters an ID for the new instance.
What is not covered in my experience is how to create instances within a program,
ie by asking the user to enter data, eg firstname, lastname, gender, dob for a new student instance.
Teachers who have been accustomed to using MS Access will know that IDs are created, typically by
using autonumber or by a combination of a sequential number and initials.
The student-class.py script is an attempt to create a student instance with an ID generated from a list
to which students are added.

I would like comment please on whether this approach is OK or whether, as I suspect, there is a much
better way of doing it.
